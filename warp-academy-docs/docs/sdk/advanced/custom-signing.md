# Custom Signing

By default in order to sign any transactions, user's wallet of type [`JWKInterface`](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js/blob/master/src/common/lib/wallet.ts#L7) or `use_wallet` (when in browser) needs to be passed as an argument for the method.

Please refer to [`warp-contracts-plugin-signature` section](../advanced/plugins/signature.md) to read the docs.
